  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Coconut is one of my favorite flavors, and I love its nutty flavor when 
    toasted. It's a natural pairing with almonds, rolled oats, and warming spices
    like cinnamon and cardamom; using coconut oil amps up the flavor even more. 
    This recipe comes together in a few minutes and will last for several weeks 
    in a closed container, making it a great make-ahead breakfast option.</p>

      20 minutes into baking time so that it browns evenly.
